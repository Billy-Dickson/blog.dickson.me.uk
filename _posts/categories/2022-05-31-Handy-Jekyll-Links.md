2. [Minimum Mistakes Cheatsheet](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-11-Minimal_Mistakes_Cheat_Sheet/)
3. Wordpress addon called [Wordpress Jekyll Explorer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/) that I'm going to try and use to export my old Wordpress Site to a Jekyll.
4. Here is a helpful links that describe a number of options for converting WordPress to [Jekyll](https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll). I'll update these link as then try them, at the moment they are a reminder to myself.
