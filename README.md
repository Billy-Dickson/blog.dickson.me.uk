# Introduction

## This is where my website is hosted

The source for my [website](https://www.dickson.me.uk) hosted on GitHub Pages and distributed by [cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) using [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/#:~:text=Cloudflare%20Pages%20is%20a%20JAMstack,to%20collaborate%20and%20deploy%20websites.&text=Developer%2Dfocused%20with%20effortless%20Git,performance%20on%20Cloudflare's%20edge%20network.).

The website functions as an online technology blog, as well as a place for me to rant & rave about technology and other topic that interest me.

For a more detailed guide on how the site was built, check out the how-to post on the blog (still to write!)

Site is built in jekyll on top of Minimal Mistakes. Using some of my own images. If you have questions, drop me a email.
