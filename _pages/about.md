### Occupation

I've worked in the Information Technology field for many years, 25 years of which at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk). If you buy me a coffee, and I'll happily tell you all about it :wink:.

Would I recommend working in Academia as of 2022, no probably not, these days it seems to be about "Sweating your assets", "Working Smarter", "Above and Beyond". Lips service is paid to "Work Life Balance" and "Mental Health", unfortunately it's only lip service. If its your first job in IT, I would definitely say "Yes" as you will learn a lot, but I wouldn't recommend staying longer than 2-3 years. I'm hoping this this changes in the future.

I started my new job this year on 7th March 2022, It was definitely time for me to move on, and I'm glad I did.

### Marital Status

Long time partner, now my wife from 31st October 2006, yes I know its Halloween, but that's the way we roll.

### Family

Son,  Sister, Parents, Uncles, Aunties, Nieces, Nephews, and numerous Cousins and second Cousin.

### Religion

None, I lean towards the [Humanist](https://www.humanism.scot/what-we-do/what-is-humanism/) philosophy.

### Outlook

Optimistic

### Likes

Spending time with friend and socialising, playing pool, travelling and holidays! keeping fit and going to the gym, tinkering about with new technology. I also enjoy reading, photography, Chinese, Tai, India and Italian food.

#### IT, Web Technologies and Home Automation

Web Technologies Such as HTML and CSS, Networking and Computer Technologies

I'm currently in in the process of resurrecting my [old blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20180516212904/http://www.dickson.me.uk/) and converting it from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) to  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

#### Home Automation and IOT

I'm currently using a [Hubitat Bridge](https://hubitat.com/), but I'm thinking of moving onto the  [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) ecosystem (after the chip shortage isn't a thing).

I also have an interest in Smart Lighting and Smart Heating using a mobile applications such as Amazon or Google Home for control.

#### Music

I’ve got a pretty eclectic taste: 80’s Alternative, Goth, Metal to The Smiths, NIN, The Ramones, Bauhaus, Portishead, [Attrition UK](https://attritionuk.bandcamp.com/) to name but a few. I've played bass guitar in various bands when I was younger and still enjoy playing now and again, either on my own, or jamming with friends.

My current favourites band at the moment are [Amyl and the Sniffers](https://www.amylandthesniffers.com/), feel free to check them out on Youtube if you have the time.
