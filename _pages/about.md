### Occupation

I started my new job this year on 7th March 2022, It was definitely time for me to move on, and I'm glad I did.

Not religious
### Music Taste
I’ve got a pretty eclectic taste: 80’s Alternative, Goth, Metal to The Smiths, NIN, The Ramones, Bauhaus, Portishead, to name but a few.

Spending time with friend and socialising, playing pool, travelling and holidays! keeping fit and going to the gym, tinkering about with new technology. I also enjoy reading, photography, Chinese, Tai, India and Italian food. I used to play bass guitar in various bands when I was younger and still enjoy playing now and again, either on my own or jamming with friends.
