My home server is currently in my loft, although at some point I do intend to put it in a cupboard under the stairs (very Harry Potter :smile:), I don’t feel the need to keep it small or unobtrusive, and the airflow is reasonably good in a larger case.

It was originally built on October 2017 (it's now 5 years old and still running well), a few parts have been replaced over the years, as of today, this is the list of the parts and a few photos. I've also included the prices paid at the time, no doubt these have gone down since 2017, apart from the hard drives it would seem.

### Power Supply Needed (Rough Calculation)

There’s a really good article [here](https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/proper-power-supply-sizing-guidance.38811/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1666005686712431&usg=AOvVaw3fWtXxbU1ao3xzj10ko_LA) about calculating the required power supply wattage. I initially started using 4 but over time I managed to fill them up, at that point it rebuilt my server with 8 drives.

| Working out | | Power|
|:-|-:|-:|
| Each drive will need approximately 35 Watts each |                6 X 35    |     210W |
| Approximately 25W for the motherboard | |                                          25W |
| The motherboard Maximum Supported Wattage | |                                      80W |
| 4 slots available on the motherboard for memory |             4 X 6         |      24W |
| 2 built in fans on the Fractal Design Case + CPU Fan  |      3 X 30         |      90W |
| **Approximate Total Wattage** | |                                             **429W** |
| **Multiply the wattage by 1.25 to give a reasonable margin of error** | |  **536.25W** |

So, I’m looking for a 550 Watt power supply and since it seems to be recommended on the Freenas Forum, I’m going to buy the Seasonic G550 550W 80+ Gold Certified PSU after reading some good reviews about it here and here.

How to calculate energy cost of an appliance

1. Find its wattage
2. Know 1000W is a Kilowatt (kW)
3. You pay roughly 34p per kW per hour

So 100W (a tenth of a kW) appliance on for two hours is 3.4p an hour x 2 = 6.8p
