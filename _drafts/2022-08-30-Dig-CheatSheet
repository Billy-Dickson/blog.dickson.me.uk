## Being Selective

You don’t have to settle for the two extremes of tight-lipped and garrulous. The dig command allows you to selectively include or exclude sections from the results.

The following query options will remove that section from the results:

* +nocomments: Don’t show comment lines.
* +noauthority: Don’t show the authority section.
* +noadditional: Don’t show the additional section.
* +nostats: Don’t show the stats section.
* +noanswer: Don’t show the answer section.
* +noall: Don’t show anything!

The +noall query option is usually combined with one of those above to include a section in the results. So, instead of typing a long string of query options to turn off multiple sections, you can use +noall to turn them all off.

You can then use the following inclusive query options to turn those you want to see back on:

* +comments: Show comment lines.
* +authority: Show the authority section.
* +additional: Show the additional section.
* +stats: Show the stats section.
* +answer: Show the answer section.
* +all: Show everything.
